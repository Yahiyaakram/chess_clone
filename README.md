# chess_clone

This code is for a real-time multiplayer chess game using Node.js, Express, and Socket.io. The server-side code handles player connections, assigns roles (white, black, or spectator), and manages the chess game logic using the `chess.js` library. The client-side code is responsible for rendering the chessboard, handling piece movement via drag-and-drop, and updating the board state in real-time based on player moves or other events from the server.

- Server (Node.js/Express/Socket.io):
  - Creates a web server and sets up Socket.io for real-time communication.
  - Manages player connections, assigns roles, and handles game logic.
  - Broadcasts moves to all connected clients and updates the board state.
  
- Client (HTML/JavaScript/Socket.io):
  - Renders the chessboard and pieces.
  - Allows players to move pieces by dragging and dropping.
  - Sends move data to the server and updates the board based on server responses.

This setup allows multiple players to join the game and play against each other or watch as spectators.
